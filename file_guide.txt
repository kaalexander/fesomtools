*****INTERACTIVE/GENERAL PLOTS*****
Important note: Before running any FESOM plotting scripts, make sure you edit
                the rotation parameters alpha, beta, and gamma inside
		fesom_grid.py (top of the function "fesom_grid") and also
		unrotate_vector.py to suit your mesh. If you're running with a
		non-rotated mesh, set them all to zero.

fesom_vis.py: Command-line interface for interactive plots.
              To run: Open python or ipython and type "run fesom_vis.py".
	              The script will ask you what kind of plot you want
		      (lon-lat or lat-depth) and will then ask you for more
		      information (file paths, variable names, whether to
		      save the plot or display it on screen, etc) as necessary.
		      When the plot is finished it will ask you for changes
		      to the settings, so you don't have to type them all in
		      again if only a few have changed, and will repeat this
		      as many times as you want.

lonlat_plot.py: Creates a lon-lat (i.e. horizontal) plot, either a global
                Cartesian projection or a circumpolar Antarctic projection.
		You can plot the given variable at the surface, at the bottom,
		at a specific depth, vertically averaged throughout the entire
		water column, or vertically averaged between two specific
		depths.
		To run: This script can be called by fesom_vis.py, but you can
		        also call it directly by opening python or ipython and
			typing "from lonlat_plot import *" followed by
			"lonlat_plot(args)" where args are the input arguments
			as described in detail near the top of the file. Note
			that these arguments include "elements" and "patches";
			to get these you will need to call the function
			function "make_patches" in patches.py.

zonal_avg_plot.py: Creates a latitude-depth plot of a zonally averaged variable
                   (can be averaged along all longitudes or between two
		   specific longitudes).
		   To run: This script can be called by fesom_vis.py, but you
		           can also call it directly by opening python or
			   ipython and typing "from zonal_avg_plot import *"
			   followed by "zonal_avg_plot(args)" where args are
			   the input arguments as described in detail near the
			   top of the file.

zonal_slice_plot.py: Creates a latitude-depth plot at a specific longitude
                     slice.
                     To run: This script can be called by fesom_vis.py, but you
		             can also call it directly by opening python or
			     ipython and typing "from zonal_slice_plot import *"
			     followed by "zonal_slice_plot(args)" where args
			     are the input arguments as described in detail
			     near the top of the file.


*****SPECIFIC PLOTS*****

grid_res.py: Plots the horizontal grid resolution (square root of the area of
             each triangular element) for the given FESOM mesh.
	     To run: Open python or ipython and type "run grid_res.py". The
	             script will prompt you for the mesh directory, the
		     filename for the figure, and whether the projection should
		     be global lat-lon or circumpolar Antarctic.

plot_depth.py: Plots the seafloor depth for the given FESOM mesh, using the
               intermediate mesh generation file depth.out rather than the final
	       depth of the bottom-most elements (although you can un-comment
	       this option if you'd rather).
	       To run: If you want to read a different file, say depth_1.out
	               instead of depth.out for a different stage of mesh
		       generation, edit this filename about halfway down the
		       file. Then open python or ipython and type
		       "run plot_depth.py". The script will prompt you for the
		       mesh directory, the filename for the figure, and whether
		       the projection should be global lat-lon or circumpolar
		       Antarctic.

plot_shelf.py: Plots the surface depth for the given FESOM mesh, i.e. the
               ice shelf draft as seen by the nodes, in a circumpolar Antarctic
	       projection.
	       To run: Open python or ipython and type "run plot_shelf.py". The
	               script will prompt you for the mesh directory, the

                    the given FESOM mesh, in a circumpolar Antarctic projection.
		    To run: Open python or ipython and type
		            "run plot_num_layers.py". The script will prompt you
			    for the mesh directory and the filename for the
			    figure.

           averaged over the given year of FESOM simulation.
	   To run: Open python or ipython and type "run bwtemp.py". The script
	           will prompt you for the mesh directory, the FESOM output
		   file containing one year of ocean averages, and whether you
		   want to save the figure (and if so, what filename) or display
		   it on the screen.

bwsalt.py: Creates a circumpolar plot of bottom water salinity annually
           averaged over the given year of FESOM simulation.
	   To run: Open python or ipython and type "run bwtemp.py". The script
	           will prompt you for the mesh directory, the FESOM output
		   file containing one year of ocean averages, and whether you

                       last year of simulation with FESOM, compared with NSIDC
		       satellite data for 1995.
		       To run: First edit the NSIDC file paths if necessary.
		               Then open python or ipython and type

			       prompt you for the mesh directory, the FESOM
			       output file containing one year of 5-day averages
			       for sea ice variables, the month number (1-12),
			       and whether you want to save the figure (and if
			       so, what filename) or display it on the screen.
			       The script will repeat as many times as you like
			       which is handy if you want to change just one
			       parameter, e.g. the month number.

nsidc_aice_seasonal.py: Plot seasonal averages of sea ice concentration over the
                        last year of simulation with FESOM, compared with NSIDC

			        Then open python or ipython and type
			        "run nsidc_aice_seasonal.py". The script will
				prompt you for the mesh directory, paths to
				two FESOM output files containing one year each
				of 5-day averages for sea ice variables (the
				script will use December for the first year and
				January-November for the second year so that
				DJF is a continuous time period), and whether
				you want to save the figure (and if so, what
				filename) or display it on the screen. This
				script is non-repeating.

sose_fesom_seasonal.py: Creates a 4x2 plot comparing lat vs. depth slices of
                        seasonally averaged temperature or salinity at the
			given longitude, between FESOM (given year of
			simulation) and SOSE (2005-2010 climatology).
			To run: First edit the path to the SOSE seasonal
			        climatology file if necessary (if you don't
				have this file ask Kaitlin for it). Then open
				python or ipython and type
				"run sose_fesom_seasonal.py". The script will
				prompt you for the mesh directory, paths to
				two FESOM output files containing one year each
				of 5-day avearges for ocean variables (the
				script will use December for the first year and
				January-November for the second year so that
				DJF is a continuous time period), whether you
				want to plot temperature or salinity, the
				longitude to plot, the deepest depth to plot,
				and whether you want to save the figure (and if
				so, what filename) or display it on the screen.
				The script will repeat as many times as you
				want without unnecessarily re-computing the mesh
				or asking you for all the parameters again, just
				the ones you want to change.

timeseries_seaice.py: Calculate and plot timeseries of total sea ice area and
                      volume during a FESOM simulation.
		      To run: Open python or ipython and type

			      you for paths to the mesh directory, the output
			      ice.mean.nc file containing one year of 5-day
			      averages, and the log file (if it already exists,
			      previously calculated values will be read from it;
			      regardless, it will be overwritten with the full
			      timeseries at the end. This allows you to process
			      one year of simulation at a time.)

timeseries_massloss.py: Calculate and plot timeseries of basal mass loss and
                        area-averaged ice shelf melt rates from major ice

			        of 5-day averages, and the log file (if it
			        already exists, previously calculated values
				will be read from it; regardless, it will be
			        overwritten with the full timeseries at the end.
			        This allows you to process one year of
				simulation at a time.)

			   for paths to the mesh directory, the output
			   oce.mean.nc file containing one year of 5-day
			   averages, and the log file (if it already exists,
			   previously calculated values will be read from it;
			   regardless, it will be overwritten with the full
			   timeseries at the end. This allows you to process
			   one year of simulation at a time.)

timeseries_3D.py: Calculate and plot timeseries of Southern Ocean total heat
                  content, average salinity, and total kinetic energy during a
		  FESOM simulation.
		  To run: Open python or ipython and type

			  allows you to process one year of simulation at a
			  time.)

massloss_map.py: Makes a map of unexplained percent error in annually averaged
                 simulated basal mass loss from each ice shelf that is over
		 5,000 km^2 in Rignot et al., 2013.
		 To run: Make sure your logfile from timeseries_massloss.py is
		         up to date, as this script reads mass loss data from
			 that file. Then open python or ipython and type
			 "run massloss_map.py". You will be prompted for the
			 mesh directory, the log file from
			 timeseries_massloss.py, whether you want to save the
		         figure (and if so, what filename) or display it on the
		         screen, and whether you are running with Kaitlin's low
			 or high resolution mesh (if you're running with
			 something else, code in a third option and make a new
			 "area" array).

		             "run aice_hi_seasonal.py". The script will prompt
			     you for the mesh directory, paths to two FESOM
			     output files containing one year each of 5-day
			     averages for sea ice variables (the script will
			     use December for the first year and
			     January-November for the second year so that DJF
			     is a continuous time period), and whether you want
			     to save the figure (and if so, what filename) or

		      max/mins (for sea ice area and volume).
		      To run: Open python or ipython and type
			      "run timeseries_annual.py". You will be prompted
			      for the paths to each log file, and whether you
			      are running with Kaitlin's low or high resolution

			      in a third option and make a new "area" array).

aice_minmax_nsidc.py: Make a 3x2 plot showing sea ice concentration from low-res
                      FESOM, high-res FESOM, and NSDIC observations for February

		      To run: Make sure the paths near the top of the file (to
		              FESOM mesh directories, output ice.mean.nc files
			      containing 1992-2005 climatology, NSIDC files)
			      are correct. Then open python or ipython and type

                     each other.
		     To run: Make sure the paths to mesh directories near the
		             top of the file are correct. Then open python or
			     ipython and type "run grid_res_compare.py". The
			     script will ask if you want to plot the global
			     resolution (with colour scale maximum 225 km) or

		    annually averaged).
		    To run: Open python or ipython and type
		            "run ismr_plot_bound.py". The script will prompt you
			    for paths to the FESOM mesh directory and

			  repeat.

temp_salt_slice.py: 

temp_salt_seasonal.py: Make a 4x2 plot showing seasonally averaged temperature

			       December from the first file and Jan-Nov from
			       the second), the longitude to interpolate to,
			       the deepest depth to plot, and whether you want
			       to save the figure (and if so, what filename) or

			    To run: First make sure you have run
			            timeseries_massloss.py for the years
				    1992-2100 inclusive, 5-day averages. Then
				    open python or ipython and type

				    will prompt you for the paths to the FESOM
				    mesh directory and the timeseries_massloss
				    logfile, and whether you want to save the

				        timeseries_massloss.py for at least
					the first 3 repetitions of 1992-2005
					(5-day averages) for both the low-res
					and high-res spinups, and that the
					logfiles both have the name
					"massloss.log". Then make sure the paths
					to the mesh directories and experiment
					directories, near the top of this
					script, are correct. Then open python
					or ipython and type
					"run massloss_perecent_change_res.py".
					The figure will be saved as
					massloss_percent_change_res.png.

moc_lat_density.py: Calculate the meridional overturning streamfunction in
                    latitude-density space. This doesn't seem to quite work yet.
		    To run: Open python or ipython and type
		            "run moc_lat_density.py". The script will prompt you
			    for the paths to the FESOM mesh directory and
			    oce.mean.nc file containing one year of output, and
			    whether you want to save the figure (and if so,
			    what filename) or display it on the screen. Warning,
			    it is VERY slow!

sst_sss_seasonal.py: Creates a 4x2 plot of seasonally averaged sea surface
                     temperature (top row) and salinity (bottom row) over the

			     you for the paths to the FESOM mesh directory and
			     two oce.mean.nc files, each containing one year of
			     5-day averages (the script will use December from
			     the first file and Jan-Nov from the second) as well
			     as whether you want to save the figure (and if so,
			     what filename) or display it on the screen. This
			     script does not repeat.


*****BACK END*****

fesom_grid.py: Classes and routines to build an object-oriented FESOM grid
               data structure. Includes the classes Node and Element, and the
	       main function fesom_grid.
	       To run: You probably won't run this on its own, but if you need
	               an array of Element objects for any reason then open
		       python or ipython and type "from fesom_grid import *"
		       followed by
		       "elements = fesom_grid(mesh_path, circumpolar)" where
		       mesh_path is the path to the directory containing your
		       mesh files, and circumpolar is a boolean indicating
		       whether to build the data structure with a global lat-lon
		       projection (False) or a circumpolar Antarctic projection
		       (True).

fesom_sidegrid.py: Classes and routines to extract a zonal slice (depth vs.
                   latitude) of the FESOM grid as built in fesom_grid.py.
		   Includes the classes SideNode, SideNodePair, and SideElement,
		   the main function fesom_sidegrid, and some helper functions
		   doing nasty triangle interpolation and things like that.
		   To run: You will probably never run this on its own, and I
		           would recommend trying to avoid doing so because
			   it's a bit complicated. It just exists for
		           zonal_slice_plot.py and timeseries_dpt.py, so if you
			   really need to call it on its own for for some
			   reason, follow what those files do.

fesom_intersectgrid.py: Classes and routines to zonally average the FESOM grid
                        (as built in fesom_grid.py) between the given longitude
			bounds, creating a regular latitude x depth grid.
			Includes the class IntersectNode, the main function
			fesom_intersectgrid, and some helper functions doing
			nasty triangle interpolation and things like that.
			To run: You would probably never run this on its own,
			        and I would recommend trying to avoid doing so
				because it's a bit complicated. It just exists
				for zonal_avg_plot.py, so if you really need
				to call it for some reason, follow what
				zonal_avg_plot does.

patches.py: Calls fesom_grid.py and converts the Elements into triangular
            patches for plotting.
	    To run: This is called by all the existing horizontal plotting
	            routines in the last 2 sections, so you probably won't
		    need to call it directly. But if you do, open python or
		    ipython and type "from patches import *" followed by
		    "make_patches(mesh_path, circumpolar, mask_cavities)"
		    where mesh_path is the path to your mesh directory,
		    circumpolar is a boolean flag indicating whether to use
		    a global lat-lon projection (False) or a circumpolar
		    Antarctic projection (True), and mask_cavities is a
		    boolean flag indicating whether to mask out the elements
		    in ice shelf cavities (can be useful for sea ice variables).

triangle_area.py: Given the latitude and longitude of a triangular element,
                  calculate the area of the triangle in m^2. This is useful
		  for area-averages or volume-averages, as well as to calculate
		  resolution.
		  To run: You shouldn't need to, as the Element object of
		          fesom_grid.py has a class function "area" (see
			  grid_res.py for an example of how to use this).
			  But if you want to call triangle_area without the
			  whole data structure, open python or ipython and type
			  "from triangle_area import *" followed by
			  "triangle_area(lon, lat)" where lon and lat are both
			  arrays of length 3 containing longitude values (in
			  degrees east) and latitude values (in degrees north).
			  It doesn't matter whether lon is from -180 to 180
			  or from 0 to 360, because this script will convert
			  everything to Cartesian coordinates anyway.

triangle_area_latdepth.py: Given the latitude and depth of a triangular
                           segment of a SideElement, calculate the area of the
			   triangle in m^2. This is useful for calculating
			   zonal transport.
			   To run: You shouldn't need to, as the SideElement
			           object of fesom_sidegrid.py has a class
				   function "area" (see timeseries_dpt for an
				   example of how to use this). But if you
				   want to call triangle_area without the
				   whole data structure, open python or
				   ipython and type
				   "from triangle_area_latdepth.py import *"
				   followed by
				   "triangle_area_latdepth(lat, depth)" where
				   lat and depth are both arrays of length 3
				   containing the latitude values (in degrees
				   north) and the depth values (in metres,
				   negative).

unrotate_vector.py: Given a 2D vector on the rotated FESOM grid, unrotate it so
                    the components line up with regular lon-lat space and not
		    the rotated lon-lat that FESOM ran with.
                    To run: This is usually called within other scripts (see
		            lonlat.py for an example) but if you want to call
			    it on its own, open python or ipython and type
			    "from unrotate_vector.py import *" followed by
			    "ug, vg = unrotate_vector(rlon, rlat, ur, vr)" where
			    rlon and rlat are the rotated longitude and latitude
			    straight out of nod2d.out or nod3d.out (-180 to
			    180 or 0 to 360 doesn't matter), and ur and vr are
			    the x- and y- components of the vector at a single
			    time index, straight out of the FESOM output files
			    (such as u and v, or uice and vice, or stress_x and
			    stress_y). The output ug and vg are the x- and y-
			    components of the vector rotated to regular lon-lat
			    space.

monthly_avg.py: Calculate a monthly average of the given variable over the given
                month. This is hard-coded and ugly, because the FESOM output
		does not have a proper calendar attached to the time axis.
		To run: This is usually called within other scripts (see eg
		        nsidc_aice_monthly.py) but if you want to call it on
			its own, open python or ipython and type
			"from monthly_avg import *" followed by
			"monthly_data = monthlyavg(file_path, var, month)"
			where file_path is the path to a FESOM output file
			containing one year of 5-day averages, var is the
			variable name, and month is the month index from 0-11.
			The output monthly_data is an array of size n2d or n3d
			containing the monthly average of the given variable 
			at each 2D or 3D node.

seasonal_avg.py: Calculate seasonal averages (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) of the given
                 variable. This is hard-coded and ugly, because the FESOM output
		 does not have a proper calendar attached to the time axis.
		 To run: This is usually called within other scripts (see eg
		         aice_hi_seasonal.py) but if you want ot call it on its
			 own, open python or ipython and type
			 "from seasonal_avg import *" followed by
			 "seasonal_data = seasonal_avg(file1, file2, var)"
			 where file1 and file2 are paths to FESOM files
			 each containing one year of 5-day averages (the script
			 will use December from file1 and Jan-Nov from file2)
			 and var is the variable name. The output seasonal_data
			 is an array of size 4 by n2d or n3d containing the
			 seasonal averages of the given variable at each 2D or
			 3D node.


*****MAKING MODEL INPUT FILES OR POST-PROCESSING NEW OUTPUT FILES*****

unesco.py: Compute the UNESCO equation of state for seawater density. Fully
           vectorised.
	   To run: This function is called by timeseries_3D.py, but if you
                   need to call it individually, open python or ipython and type
		   "from unesco import *" followed by
		   "rho = unesco(temp, salt, press)" where temp, salt, and
		   press are arrays of the same dimensions (but any dimension is
		   fine), containing values for temperature (deg C), salinity
		   (psu), and pressure (bar, note that depth/10 where depth is
		   in m is close enough).

make_ini.py: Make a FESOM initial conditions text file, with all the columns
             in the right format, using ECCO2 temperature and salinity for
             January 1995.
	     To run: Edit the paths to theta_file, salt_file, and out_file
	             at the top of the script. Then open python or ipython
		     and type "run make_ini.py". This is pretty low-tech and
		     not encapsulated or anything.

iceberg_melt.py: Read Martin and Adcroft's monthly climatology of freshwater
                 fluxes from iceberg melt, and make an input forcing file on
		 the ERA-Interim grid.
		 To run: First edit the variables "iceberg_head",
		         "iceberg_tail", "iceberg_grid", and "era_grid" near
			 the top of the file to point to the right paths. Then
			 open python or ipython and type "run iceberg_melt.py".
			 You will be prompted or the path to the desired output
			 file.

average_years.py: Calculate a climatology of the given type of FESOM output file
                  (eg oce.mean) over the given years. It will have the same
		  frequency as the existing files (eg 5-day averages). Save to
		  a new NetCDF file.
		  To run: Make sure the variable expt_name (eg MK44005) is
		          correct for your simulation. Then open python or
			  ipython and type "run average_years.py". The script
			  will prompt you for the path to the FESOM output
			  directory, the type of file (forcing.diag, ice.diag,
			  ice.mean, oce.mean), the range of years to process,
			  and the desired output climatology file.

common_grid.py: For various 2D fields, calculate the monthly climatology of
                FESOM output and interpolate to a regular grid (quarter-degree,
		circumpolar to 50S) for easy comparison with ROMS. The fields
		are: sea surface temperature and salinity, surface heat and salt
		fluxes, sea ice concentration and thickness, ocean surface
		velocity vector, sea ice velocity vector, surface stress vector,
		and curl of the surface stress.
		To run: First make sure you have a file containing the land mask
		        on the common grid (most likely interpolated from ROMS,
			see common_grid.py in my roms_tools GitHub repo). Then
			open python or ipython and type "run common_grid.py".
			The script will prompt you for paths to the FESOM mesh
			directory and output directory, the years to calculate
			the climatology over, the land mask file discussed
			above, and the desired path to the output file.
